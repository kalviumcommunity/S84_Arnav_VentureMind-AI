# VentureMind AI — RAG + Gemini (Project README)

Turn raw startup ideas into structured, pitch‑ready plans using Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) + Google Gemini.

# 🔥 What is VentureMind AI?

VentureMind AI helps founders transform a one‑line startup idea into a complete, investor‑ready brief: problem & solution, market sizing, user personas, competitor landscape, go‑to‑market, monetization, risks, roadmap, and a crisp pitch. It blends:

RAG over curated startup knowledge (frameworks, market benchmarks, competitor summaries, funding trends, pricing models, GTM playbooks).
x
Gemini LLM for fluent, context‑aware narratives and structured outputs.

Dynamic prompting that adapts to user intent, maturity, and domain.

# ️ Implementation

- Datasets & Knowledge Sources

- Web/News/Reports: Real‑time search results, startup glossaries, funding databases (optional integrations).

- Internal Docs: Prompt libraries, pitch templates, ICP/persona patterns, GTM playbooks.

- User Context: Prior conversations, saved ideas, sector preferences.

# RAG Pipeline

- Ingest & Index: Import templates, strategy docs, and curated research into a vector store.

- Retrieve: For each user idea, retrieve top‑k snippets (templates, comps, trends, benchmarks).


# LLM Prompting Features

- Zero‑shot / One‑shot / Few‑shot templates (e.g., YC‑style problem/solution, Lean Canvas, GTM checklists).

- Dynamic Prompting: Adjust prompts using user context (stage, sector, geo) and retrieval signals.

- Chain‑of‑Thought (hidden) for reasoning; outputs are concise & structured.

- Controls: temperature, top‑p, token limits; style toggles (concise, persuasive, analytical).

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

- LLM: Google Gemini API (recommendations, synthesis).

- RAG Orchestration: LangChain (retrievers, chains, prompt templates, routers).

- Retrieval Adapters (optional): Web search connectors for news, funding rounds, market stats.

- Backend: Python (FastAPI) with async handlers.
